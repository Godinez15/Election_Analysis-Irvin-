# Election Analysis(IrvinG) Module 3 instructions.

Make a copy of the PyPoll.py file that you used throughout this module and rename it PyPoll_Challenge.py.  [Done]
Create a list for the counties. [Done]
Create a dictionary where the county is the key and the votes cast for each county in the election are the values. [Done]
Create an empty string that will hold the county name that had the largest turnout. [Done]
Declare a variable that represents the number of votes that a county received. Hint: Inside a for loop, add an if statement to check if the county name has already been recorded. If not, add it to the list of county names.[Done.]
Inside the with open() function where you are outputting the file, do the following:
	~Create three if statements to print out the voter turnout results            similar to the results shown above.
	~Add the results to the output file.

	~Print the results to the command line.

# Election Analysis(IrvinG)

A Colorado Board of Election gave me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.
  1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
  2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
  3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
  4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
  5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

# Challenge Overview
------------------------------------------------------------
- Preety much we learned how to refactor code. Also, through various edits
I reorganized, looked at patterns and edited variable assignments to 
get a different type of output. I learned how to input a new line through VSC.
Apart from also getting some practice connecting actual Excel files to VSC,
I also got more practice organizing my code, using comments so that I know exactly 
what's going on.

# Challenge Summary
------------------------------------------------------------
To summarize this whole challenge, it was an incredible practice in applying 
basic everyday use fundamentals in order to pull certain data and then organize that
same data to a more clean and easy to read format to use in maybe a presentation???
I loved this Module can't wait for the next.
